# Workshop Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the Workshop Repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts is designed to showcase how to develop and deploy a machine learning system, in a few hours. It follows the general pattern of the FTI pipelines (feature,training,inference)

## Repository Structure
- **busyness_model/**: Houses the model registry and related scripts for business analytics.
- **functions/**: Contains utility functions and scripts to enhance model functionality.
- **Notebooks**:
  - **`bar-feature-engineering.ipynb`**: Feature engineering.
  - **`bar-training.ipynb`**: Trains machine learning models.
  - **`inference and function calling.ipynb`**: Inference and function calling mechanisms.

## What you will learn
- **Feature Engineering**: State-of-the-art usage of the feature store for manipulating data as dataframe.
- **Model Training**: Easily train, evaluate, and optimize machine learning model.
- **Embeddings**: A bit of LLMs
- **Inference Pipelines**: Integrate model inference
- **real-time stuff** A real-time ML System.
